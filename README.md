# websocket-server

WebSocket library for Python, with emphasis on code quality and simple static file integration.

## Description

This is a little stand-alone library for WebSocket servers.
It integrates neatly with the standard library, providing easily set-up
servers for both WebSockets and other content. It is intended for
small-scale usages, where installing a proper framework would require
too much work.

## Installation

Use the usual methods, like cloning the repository and running `setup.py install`, or
`pip install git+https://github.com/CylonicRaider/websocket-server.git`.

## Example

After having installed the library (or having it available locally otherwise), run

    python3 -m websocket_server

in a command line, and navigate your WebSocket-enabled Web browser to
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Documentation

Apply the pydoc tool of your choice to the package.
