"""
Support for "sessions" spanning multiple WebSocket connections.

In some (or many) cases, multiple WebSocket connections to the same URL are
(mostly) interchangeable. This module caters for that case by providing a
WebSocketSession class that transparently handles re-connecting to a WebSocket
endpoint, retrying commands whose results may have been missed, etc.

This module is NYI.
